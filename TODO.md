Graphql LSP not working
https://www.npmjs.com/package/graphql-language-service-server#user-content-graphql-configuration-file
:LspLog gives some useful information

modularize lazy-plugins

I remember seeing a quote/paren/bracket autocomplete that I wanted.
It's called mini.pairs

Telescope search by directory
Seems to be an example in :help oil-actions

Can optimize oil a bit more, commands for opening oil from the home directory or closing oil seem useful

Optimize git diff workflow, gf needs to close the diff i think
